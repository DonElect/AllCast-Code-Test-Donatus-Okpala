# AllCast-Code-Test-Donatus-Okpala

Simple Task Manager:
- Create a simple task manager API with endpoints for:
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks
- Assigning tasks to users
- Marking tasks as completed
- User authentication and authorization
- Use MySQL as the database
- Create a simple React frontend to test the API


How to use:
1. For the backend, all you have to do is to configure your prefered database. Set the database url, database name and password.
2. For the front end, i am using react vite. So all you have to do after cloning is to run "npm install" to install all the neccessary packages and you are go to go.
3. If you run the front end on a seperate port of localhost other than 5173, you have to add it as one of the allowed origin in the back end under security else the call will not be permited.
